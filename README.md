# Gemmini-mlir
[MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) supports [Gemmini](https://github.com/ucb-bar/gemmini),code from [buddy-compiler](https://github.com/buddy-compiler/buddy-mlir).
## motivation
* I expected to have a separate repository for MLIR support for Gemmini.
* Keeping the code clean,for example, what you can see is that the way I extended llvm here was to patch it directly...
